        <h2>Welcome to the SEC, Mizzou!</h2>
        <p>As a graduate of the University of Missouri (Mizzou), I enjoy following their football program.  Lately, there has been a lot of excitement surrounding the program.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 2012, Missouri left the Big 12 to join the SEC.</p>
        <h2>First Season Struggles</h2>
        <p>Even though Missouri had recent success under new head coach Gary Pinkel, Mizzou was not known as a historical power in football.</p>
        <p>The first year of SEC play was difficult.  Mizzou had a losing record at 5-7 and missed a bowl game for the first time in years.</p>
        <h2>Too Many Injuries</h2>
        <p>What went largely unnoticed was that Mizzou had a myriad of injuries in their first year of SEC play, which played a large factor in what would happen the next couple of years.</p>
        <h2>Rise to Multiple Championships</h2>
        <p>In the next two years, Mizzou was able to keep a healthy roster and dominate the SEC East.  In 2013 and 2014, Mizzou would collect a 7-1 SEC record and win the SEC East both seasons.</p>
        <h2>Tough to Keep the Momentum Going</h2>
        <p>Despite the recent success, Mizzou continually gets picked to finish in the middle of the SEC.  This year, an early loss to an improving Kentucky program seemed to confirm the doubters.  Yet there is reason for optimism, due to a quarterback switch.</p>

        <h2>Rare Quarterback Chaos</h2>
        <p>Maty Mauk, who has been the beloved hero quarterback for Missouri football for the last two years and who was picked preseason as one of the top SEC quarterbacks, has unfortunately had a subpar year at quarterback.</p>
        <h2>Meet Drew Lock</h2>
        <p>Missouri had the benefit of recruiting 4-star quarterback prospect Drew Lock.  Originally the plan was to redshirt Lock, allowing him an extra year of development and eligibility since Mauk was so well established.</p>
        <h2>True Freshman Too Good To Ignore</h2>
        <p>However, Lock played so well in training camp that the coaching staff felt that they had no option but to let Lock get a share of the playing time this year.</p>
        <h2>Mysterious Suspension</h2>
        <p>For some unknown reason, Missouri surprisingly suspended Mauk for one week.  After that time, another surprise came as Missouri suspended Mauk indefinitely.</p>
        <h2>Opportunity Calling</h2>
        <p>While that news is sad for Mauk fans, the opportunity for Lock to start surfaced.  Lock has played at an incredibly high level since, and on October 10th he will face his biggest test of the season so far:  The Florida Gators.</p>
        <h2>Difficult Opponent Up Next</h2>
        <p>Saturday will show whether Lock is able to continue the moment of Missouri football this season.</p>
